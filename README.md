## Architecture

### Components

- `App.tsx`: Main application layout
- `DirectorySelector.tsx`: Project directory management
- `ProjectSelector.tsx`: Firebase project selection
- `DeploymentPanel.tsx`: Deployment controls
- `EmulatorPanel.tsx`: Emulator management
- `SecretsPanel.tsx`: Environment secrets handling
- `DependencyInstaller.tsx`: Dependency management
- `LogsPanel.tsx`: Real-time logging display

### Context Providers

- `ProjectContext.tsx`: Project directory state management
- `LogsContext.tsx`: Logging system state management

### Core Services

- `POST /api/firebase/emulators`: Manage emulators
- `GET /api/firebase/projects`: List Firebase projects
- `POST /api/secrets/fetch`: Fetch environment secrets
- `POST /api/firebase/install-dependencies`: Install project dependencies

## WebSocket Communication

Real-time updates are handled through WebSocket connections:

- Endpoint: `ws://localhost:3001/api/firebase/deploy-logs`
- Provides real-time feedback for:
  - Deployments
  - Emulator status
  - Dependency installation
  - Error messages
